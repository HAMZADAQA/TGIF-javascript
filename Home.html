                    <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                        transparency
                        is
                        government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens
                        hold
                        their
                        public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
                    <p>TGovernments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
                        and
                        spend
                        taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
                        and
                        just
                        governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about
                        what
                        their
                        Government is doing.</p>
                    <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                        Government's
                        effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                        society,
                        and
                        public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
                        our
                        site to
                        become actively engaged in American government.</p>
                    <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                        public
                        feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                    <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                        opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                        attack
                        on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage
                        of
                        formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
                        example,
                        (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
                        part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the
                        philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                        public sphere.</p>
                    <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom
                        of
                        the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of
                        the
                        press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen
                        to
                        row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians
                        and
                        writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>
                    <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is
                        often
                        linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to
                        have
                        adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern
                        provisions to
                        the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
                        independence
                        in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                        legislation
                        in 1999).</p>
                    <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                        Information
                        Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
